    <h1>Hero</h1>
    <p>
        A person that I really admire is Don Lind, former naval officer and NASA Astronaut. One reason I admire him is for his tenacity.
        He was assigned to one of the Apollo missions which was cancelled. Don Lind was assigned to the SkyLab 2 mission,
        which was cancelled. (The SkyLab 2 module is now in the Smithsonian.) Finally Don Lind was assigned to STS-51-B.
        This was the first and only space flight that he was on.

                            <p> A personality trait that helps me as developer is that I can understand the desired result and
                                develop a plan to reach the goal. (Just donâ€™t ask me to come up with the new idea. That takes
                                I have really enjoyed my time learning about coding. It's amazing what you can do on the
                                computer.</p>

                            <p> As I went through the Coding Bootcamp, I found out that I really enjoyed working on the frontend
                                of websites. I like to make the websites user friendly and easy to navigate.</p>

                            <p>I love to read and do crafts. I like being able to talk to people versus being part of a large
                                group. I enjoy working with groups, it makes the work a lot easier and faster!</p>
