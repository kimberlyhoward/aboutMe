                        I am a former school teacher who has spent a lot of time working with computers. I enjoyed designing and maintaining websites
                        for school that I decided to switch and make it my full-time job! I really enjoyed my time learning
                        about coding. It's amazing what you can do on the computer.</td>
                    <td>
                        A personality trait that helps me as developer is that I can understand the desired result and develop a plan to reach the
                        goal. (Just donâ€™t ask me to come up with the new idea. That takes a lot longer.)

                    <td>
                        As I went through the Coding Bootcamp, I found out that I really enjoyed working on the frontend of websites. I like to make
                        the websites user friendly and easy to navigate.

                        I love to read and do crafts. I like being able to talk to people versus being part of a large group. I enjoy working with
                        groups, it makes the work a lot easier and faster!
